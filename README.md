 A command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md based on the user's input. The user will be prompted for his/her GitHub username, which will be used to make a call to the GitHub API to retrieve his/her email and profile image. The user will then be prompted with questions about his/her project such as installation, license, contributors, usage etc. Using Async function (Asynchronous JavaScript), a Good Readme Markdown file is created.  I have also added my friendâ€™s (Sujatha M) Github account as contributor, after getting her consent, to showcase that this Readme generator could successfully add contributors to Project.
